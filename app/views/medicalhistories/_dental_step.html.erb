     We believe that each patient deserves to know what their current level of dental health is, how they got there, and what treatment options are available to help them reach the level of health that they deserve. This begins with a careful diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. We will perform a comprehensive oral examination of your teeth, gums, jaw joints, bite and soft tissues. We will also take the appropriate x-rays, and when beneficial we may take additional diagnostic records such as photographs or casts of your teeth to further evaluate areas of concern.
Once all your records have been completed they will be carefully evaluated to determine your current level of dental health and how you got there. We will review our findings with you and discuss your treatment options. A personalized treatment plan will then be developed to help you achieve the goals we set together.
